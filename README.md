# DelhiMetro
## Python and Tkinter GUI

This Python project aims to find the best and shortest route to travel in the Delhi Metro with a user-friendly GUI made with Tkinter. It is a project based on data structures and algorithms. For this project, I used three algorithms from the field of computer science: Graphs, Data Structure, and Breadth-First Search. The following Data Structures were used to calculate and find the Best and Shortest Metro Route.
